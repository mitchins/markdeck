## Main Feature

### Nested Sublane 1
- 🟢 Task A1
    Multi-line description
    with special characters: @#$%^&*()
    [Link 1](http://example.com) [Link 2](http://test.com)

### Nested Sublane 2
- 🔴 Blocked task B1
    **BLOCKED:** Dependencies not ready

## Another Feature

- 🔵 Task C1

Custom text between lanes.

### Deep Nesting
- 🟢 Task D1
    Very long description that goes on and on and on and on and on
    and continues for many lines to test handling of long text
    and make sure we don't have issues with buffer sizes or truncation

## Notes Section

Preserved notes with **markdown** formatting.

- Unrelated bullet point (not a card)
- Another non-card bullet

```
